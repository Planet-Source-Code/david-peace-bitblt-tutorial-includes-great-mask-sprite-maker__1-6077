## BitBlt Tutorial \- Includes GREAT Mask\\Sprite Maker


</div>

### Description

This tutorial is great, I wish I had this when I was a begginer. It goes step-by-step through every aspect of BitBlt. I also included a program I made that really helps me, MaskMagic 1.0, it is a Sprite \ Mask maker, and you can do several pictures at one time. It's truly a great program. This a must have package, it has everything you need to get started with BitBlt. Leave feedback.
